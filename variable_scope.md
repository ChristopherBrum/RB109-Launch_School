###What is a Variable?###

A variable is a container that stores information that can be referenced and manipulated within a computer program. A variable also provides a way of labeling this data in a descriptive way so that the program can be understood more clearly by ourselves and others reading our code. 

>Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used throughout your program.
